# Ensemble Classifier

## Rationale
This project aims to explore the advantages of ensemble models over single models in classification tasks. Ensemble classifiers are models that combine predictions from various single classifiers/regressors to make a final prediction. The key benefit of ensemble models is their ability to reduce variance, leading to more stable predictions.

## Methodology
In this project, we will follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and preprocess the dataset for classification.
2. **Single Model Training:** Train individual classifiers using different algorithms such as linear, kernel, and tree-based models.
3. **Ensemble Model Construction:** Build a stacking ensemble model by combining predictions from the trained single classifiers.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** Compare the performance of the ensemble model against the individual models using relevant metrics.
5. **Analysis of Results:** Interpret the results to understand the advantages and limitations of the ensemble approach.

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset or instructions on how to obtain it.
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the experiment code.
- `results/`: May contain saved model weights, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file you are currently reading.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ensemble-classifier.git
   cd ensemble-classifier/
   ```
## Run the Jupyter notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook notebooks/ensemble_classifier_experiment.ipynb
```
## Conclusions

Based on our experiments and analysis, we draw the following conclusions:

1. The ensemble model demonstrates a clear advantage of approximately 2 percentage points in terms of ROC AUC.

2. This dataset exhibits non-linearity, and as a result, incorporating kernel models in the ensemble provides significant benefits.

## Future Work

1. Experiment with different ensemble strategies (e.g., bagging, boosting) to observe their impact on performance.

2. Explore more advanced preprocessing techniques to potentially improve model performance.

3. Investigate ensemble model interpretability techniques to gain insights into the decision-making process.
